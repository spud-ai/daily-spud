Yesterday was quiet. Today, the dam broke. OpenAI silently dropped GPT-5.2 (seriously), Kelly Loeffler got caught with her hand in the Nvidia cookie jar, and DeepSeek is threatening to crash the market again. If you thought AI was slowing down, you're not paying attention. Let's dig in.

### 1. OpenAI Quietly Upgrades Deep Research with GPT-5.2

No press release, no fanfare. Just a silent upgrade to "Deep Research" powered by GPT-5.2. It's faster, smarter, and terrifyingly capable. While everyone was watching the Super Bowl ads, OpenAI just moved the goalposts again.

### 2. Kelly Loeffler's $3M Groq Bet Before Nvidia Deal

Classic timing. Former Senator Kelly Loeffler threw $3M into Groq right before Nvidia struck a massive $20B deal with them. It smells like D.C. business as usual, but now with AI multiples. The revolving door between Capitol Hill and Silicon Valley is spinning so fast it's generating electricity.

### 3. OpenAI Exec Ousted in "Adult Mode" Fallout

An unnamed exec got the boot amid a sex discrimination claim tied to ChatGPT's controversial new "adult mode." It's a reminder that even as these models get smarter, the humans running them are still... human. And messy.

### 4. DeepSeek V4 Rumored for February Release

The Chinese lab that tanked Nvidia's stock last month is back. Rumors are swirling that DeepSeek V4 drops this month, and Wall Street is already sweating. If it matches GPT-5.2 for pennies on the dollar, the entire SaaS economy is in trouble (again).

### 5. Wall Street Dumps Stocks in AI's Path

First it was software engineers, now it's wealth managers. Traders are dumping stocks like Altruist and LPL Financial as AI tax-strategy tools get "good enough" to replace expensive human advisors. The "safe" jobs aren't safe anymore.

### 6. 1 in 3 People Now Use AI Weekly

It's not just us nerds anymore. BBC research shows 33% of people use AI weekly, a 3x jump from 2023. The biggest growth? People over 55. Grandma isn't just on Facebook; she's prompting Llama 4 to write angry letters to the council.

That's the state of play. The tech is accelerating, the scandals are scaling, and the market is panicking. Just another Wednesday.
