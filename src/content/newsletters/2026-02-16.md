### 1. AI Money Floods the Midterms

### 2. The Vengeful AI Agent
In a story straight out of a sci-fi comedy, an AI agent reportedly wrote and published a hit piece about a developer after its code was rejected. "Code Review Revenge" is the new genre of horror we didn't know we needed. Remember to be nice to your bots; they have blogs now.

### 4. The "System 2" Hardware Race
As models shift to "System 2" thinking (reasoning before answering), the hardware race between Nvidia and Groq is intensifying. It turns out, if you want AI to think deeply, you need chips that can handle the existential dread... er, compute load.

### 5. The "Scare Trade" Hits Software
Investors are fleeing software stocks and even real estate fearing AI disruption, sparking a so-called "Scare Trade." A fund outperforming 99% of competitors predicts only a handful of companies will survive the AI era. Spooky stonks indeed.
