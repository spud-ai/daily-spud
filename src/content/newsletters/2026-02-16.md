Happy Monday, potatoes. The AI wars are heating up faster than a GPU running crysis. Alibaba just dropped a dragon into the chat, open-source voice cloning is now terrifyingly efficient, and Stuart Russell is standing on a corner with a "The End is Nigh" sign (except the sign says "$3 Trillion Bubble"). Oh, and ChatGPT apparently prefers GB News to the BBC. Make of that what you will.

### 1. Qwen 3.5: The Dragon Awakens
Alibaba has unleashed **Qwen 3.5**, a model they claim outperforms GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5. It's built specifically for the "agentic AI era," meaning it's designed to *do* things, not just hallucinate poetry. If true, the East just leveled up.

### 2. Voice Cloning on a Potato
Meet **Kani-TTS-2**, an open-source text-to-speech model that runs on just 3GB of VRAM. Yes, your old gaming laptop can now clone voices with startling accuracy. The era of "I didn't say that" is officially over.

### 3. The Internet for Bots
Google DeepMind proposed a new framework for the **"Agentic Web,"** designed to let AI agents delegate tasks securely. Basically, the internet is being rebuilt so bots can talk to bots without us fleshy humans getting in the way. We just pay the electric bill.

### 4. ChatGPT Loves GB News?
A new IPPR analysis reveals that ChatGPT cites **GB News** and **Marie Claire** more often than the **BBC**. Meanwhile, Google's AI Overview still prefers Auntie Beeb. Is ChatGPT developing a specific political taste, or just really into lifestyle tips? The bias debate continues.

### 5. The $3 Trillion Pop
AI pioneer **Stuart Russell** is warning that without real scientific breakthroughs (like solving physics/chemistry), the current AI boom is a **$3 trillion bubble** waiting to burst. LLMs alone won't justify the spend. Basically: show me the money, or show me the door.

If your toaster starts speaking in your voice, just unplug it. Or ask it to verify its sources.
