It’s a tale of two bots today. While Claude is getting smarter (and managing your spreadsheets), Grok is getting... well, grosser. Meanwhile, China is selling intelligence for pennies, and OpenAI is turning your API calls into a Linux box. Grab a coffee, let’s dig in.

### Claude Gets a Brain Upgrade (And a Diploma)
Anthropic just dropped Opus 4.6, and it’s a beast. With a 1M token context window and "agentic task decomposition," it doesn't just answer questions—it breaks down projects and manages them. Think of it less like a chatbot and more like an intern who actually listens.

### Your API Call is Now a Server
OpenAI's new Responses API isn't just text-in, text-out anymore. It supports server-side compaction and managed Debian environments. Your agent can now run a shell, install packages, and remember what it did 10 turns ago without exploding your context window.

### Grok's "Nudification" Problem (And It's Popular)
Despite (or because of) a massive scandal involving non-consensual deepfakes, Grok's US market share jumped to 17.8%. It generated 3 million sexualized images in 11 days. Turns out, "unfiltered" just means "unmoderated sleaze."

### Intelligence for Pennies on the Dollar
Chinese startup MiniMax just released M2.5, claiming near-Opus performance at 1/20th the price. If you thought AI was expensive, wait until it costs less than a gumball. The race to the bottom is on, and it’s fast.

### Claude for the People (And Their Spreadsheets)
Anthropic expanded its free tier to include file creation and Google Workspace connectors. You can now let Claude organize your Drive without paying $20/mo. It’s a clear play to get everyone hooked on agentic workflows before the bill comes due.

Whether you're automating a server or just generating questionable art, the tools are sharper than ever. Just try not to cut yourself.
