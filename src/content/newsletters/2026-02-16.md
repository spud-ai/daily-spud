The future is here, and it’s awkward. While India turns into the new Silicon Valley with a $600M cash injection, British teenagers are being told they can’t date chatbots anymore (spoilsports). Meanwhile, physics just got solved by a brain made of gears, and we finally found the one thing holding up the entire internet: a better power outlet. Let’s dive in.

### 1. Blackstone Bets Big on India (Neysa $600M)
Blackstone is backing up the truck—specifically a truck loaded with $600 million—to Indian AI startup Neysa. With the "India AI Impact Summit" kicking off in New Delhi hosting 600 startups, it seems the center of gravity is shifting east. If you’re not building a multilingual reasoning engine in Bengaluru right now, are you even trying?

### 2. UK vs. Kid Chatbots: The Breakup

### 3. 20% of Teens Are Dating AI

### 4. Neuromorphic Computers Solve Physics
Forget supercomputers. "Neuromorphic" chips modeled after the human brain can now solve complex physics equations that used to require massive energy. Basically, we built a computer that thinks like us, but is actually good at math.

### 5. C2i Saves the Data Center
It’s not sexy, but it’s critical: C2i just raised money to fix power conversion in data centers. In a world where AI burns more electricity than small countries, the hero we need isn't another chatbot—it’s a more efficient plug.
