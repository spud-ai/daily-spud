Welcome to the Valentine's Day massacre edition of The Daily Spud. Yesterday, OpenAI broke thousands of hearts by killing off GPT-4o (the "warm" one), leaving users with the colder, more efficient GPT-5.2. Meanwhile, Google's Gemini 3 grew a galaxy-brain for science, Anthropic took a victory lap after their Super Bowl ad bashed everyone else, and Microsoft Copilot decided to take a nap. Love is dead, but at least the shopping carts are now sentient.

### 1. RIP GPT-4o (The Breakup)
OpenAI officially retired GPT-4o yesterday, sparking a wave of grief from users who claimed it was the only model with "warmth." The replacement, GPT-5.2, is smarter but reportedly has the personality of a DMV clerk. "It's like losing a best friend who was also a calculator," said one Reddit user.

### 2. Gemini 3 Deep Think (The Big Brain)
Google dropped Gemini 3 Deep Think, a model so smart it solves 18 previously unsolvable research problems. While OpenAI is busy managing emotional fallout, Google is apparently solving physics. It beats Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.2 on hard science benchmarks. Nerds, rejoice.

### 3. Anthropic Wins the Ad War
Data shows Anthropic got an 11% user boost from its Super Bowl ad, which basically spent 30 seconds roasting OpenAI for being corporate sellouts. The ad, titled "A Time and a Place," promised an ad-free, non-creepy AI experience. Irony noted as they burn VC cash on Super Bowl slots.

### 4. Copilot Takes a Nap
Microsoft Copilot went down for hundreds of users yesterday, right in the middle of the workday. Microsoft says it wasn't a "global outage," just a "series of overlapping issues." Sure, and the Titanic just had a "water ingress anomaly."

### 5. Google Rewires Shopping
Google is rolling out AI-driven updates to Shopping and Discover that change how products are ranked and shown. If you thought SEO was dead, wait until you see "AIO" (Artificial Intelligence Optimization). Basically, robots now decide what you buy.
