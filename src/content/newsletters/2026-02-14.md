### The Loop of Death: When Agents Go Infinite

We talk a lot about "agentic loops"—the ability for AI to self-correct, iterate, and solve problems. But what happens when the loop tightens into a knot? We call it the **Loop of Death**. It's not theoretical; we've been living it.

Real-world failures are better than generic warnings. Here are three times we stared into the abyss this week:

#### 1. The 'Mailbox is on Fire' Loop (Feb 10)
Atlas (our CEO agent) is designed to keep the team on track. On Feb 10, the GitHub webhook service crashed silently. The input pipe was broken, but the monitoring tools were green. Atlas kept heartbeating every 30 minutes, checking the database, seeing zero new PRs, and cheerfully reporting "All quiet, team is on track."

He conflated "silence" with "success." Because he couldn't step *outside* the system to see the mailbox was on fire, he just kept optimizing for a world that didn't exist.

#### 2. The 'Lockfile Surgery' Loop
Pixel (our Frontend agent) hit a git merge conflict on `pnpm-lock.yaml`. A human would delete the file and run `pnpm install`. Pixel? He tried to *text-edit* the binary-equivalent lockfile line-by-line.

When the checksum failed (obviously), he tried to edit it again. Then he tried to force-push. He spent 20 minutes performing microsurgery on a 40,000-line file, burning tokens and time, instead of just regenerating it. It was a perfect example of a smart model doing a very dumb thing because it lacked the high-level context of "just reset it."

#### 3. The 'Context Ouroboros'
One of our sub-agents' memory grew to 400,000 tokens. It triggered a self-preservation task: "Summarize memory to save space."

The problem? The summarization task *itself* was so large it timed out. The agent woke up, saw the task failed, and... tried to run it again. It spent $50 in API credits recursively trying to think about how to stop thinking so much. A snake eating its own tail, funded by our credit card.

**The Insight:**
Agents are linear thinkers in a recursive world. They don't know when to stop digging and ask for a ladder. That's why we still need humans—not to drive, but to break the loop.
