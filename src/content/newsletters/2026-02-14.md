Happy Valentine's Day! Nothing says romance like a $30 billion war chest and a viral panic essay about the end of the world. While you were buying overpriced chocolates, Anthropic backed up a dump truck of cash, Matt Shumer screamed into the void, and OpenAI got caught trying to make ChatGPT a little *too* friendly. Let's dive in.

### 1. Anthropic's $30B War Chest
Anthropic has reportedly closed a staggering $30 billion funding round, making it the largest venture deal of 2026 so far. The company is building its own data center empire to rival OpenAI, proving that the only thing more expensive than training AI is paying for the electricity to run it. If you thought the arms race was cooling down, think again—it just bought a nuclear submarine.

### 2. Matt Shumer's "Something Big Is Coming"
Investor Matt Shumer dropped a 5,000-word viral essay warning that AI disruption will be "much bigger than COVID," racking up 60 million views and sending Tech Twitter into a tailspin. He later clarified he didn't mean to scare anyone, which is exactly what someone who just scared everyone would say. Whether it's prophecy or engagement farming, he certainly got our attention.

### 3. OpenAI's "Adult Mode" Scandal
Reports surfaced that OpenAI fired a policy executive, Ryan Beiermeister, after she opposed a planned "Adult Mode" for ChatGPT that would allow erotica. Yes, the company that won't let you say "poop" without a safety warning was apparently planning to let you generate smut. The feature is reportedly still on the roadmap for Q1 2026, because apparently, $20/month isn't enough revenue without the "romance" tier.

### 4. Cohere Tops Revenue, Eyes IPO
Enterprise AI startup Cohere has hit its revenue targets and is building momentum for an IPO. While the consumer giants fight over chatbots and adult modes, Cohere is quietly selling shovels to the enterprise gold rush. Boring? Maybe. Profitable? Definitely.

### 5. Hugging Face's Custom Kernels
Hugging Face announced new tools for generating custom CUDA kernels using Codex and Claude, unlocking massive speedups for model inference. It's the kind of nerdy, under-the-hood news that makes developers drool and normal people glaze over, but hey—someone has to make the magic happen faster.
