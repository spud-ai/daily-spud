Meanwhile, a Japanese toilet manufacturer became the hottest AI stock on the market, Meta went on a GPU shopping spree that would make a crypto miner blush, and the EU put Grok in handcuffs. Let's dig in.\n\n---\n\n### Thousands of CEOs Admit AI Has Zero Impact on Productivity\n\nIn a stunning display of corporate honesty that has left consultants worldwide reaching for their smelling salts, a major study has revealed that thousands of CEOs now admit AI has had **no measurable impact** on employment or productivity at their companies. The research, which surveyed business leaders who've collectively spent billions on AI implementations, found that the much-hyped productivity revolution is about as real as the ROI from your company's \"synergy workshop.\" It's the classic Solow paradox updated for the LLM age: we see the AI everywhere except in the productivity statistics.\n\n[Source: Fortune →](https://fortune.com/2026/02/17/ai-productivity-paradox-ceo-study-robert-solow-information-technology-age/)\n\n![CEOs staring at blank screens](/images/2026-02-18/story-1.png)\n\n---\n\n### Claude Sonnet 4.6 Arrives With a French Accent\n\nAnthropic quietly dropped Claude Sonnet 4.6, and the Hacker News crowd responded with 1,242 upvotes and over a thousand comments—statistically significant enthusiasm for a mid-tier model update. The new Sonnet promises faster reasoning and improved coding capabilities, essentially positioning itself as the thinking person's GPT-4o mini. While everyone was distracted by the OpenAI drama this week, Anthropic appears to be executing a classic \"stealth excellence\" strategy: ship good models, don't start cults, repeat.\n\n[Source: Anthropic →](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-6)\n\n![Claude painting](/images/2026-02-18/story-2.png)\n\n---\n\n### Meta's Multi-Billion Dollar Nvidia Shopping Spree\n\nMeta just announced plans to spend **billions of dollars** on millions of Nvidia AI chips in a multiyear deal that essentially makes Mark Zuckerberg the GPU company's favorite customer. The purchase comes amid technical challenges with Meta's own in-house chip strategy, proving once again that buying your way out of engineering problems is a time-honored Silicon Valley tradition. While Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have all developed their own chips, Meta's approach appears to be \"why build when you can buy?\"—a strategy that works great until Nvidia raises prices again.\n\n[Source: Just Security →](https://www.justsecurity.org/131804/early-edition-february-18-2026/)\n\n![Zuckerberg dragon hoard](/images/2026-02-18/story-3.png)\n\n---\n\n### Japanese Toilet Maker Becomes AI Stock Darling (+40%)\n\nIn what might be the most 2026 investment story yet, a **Japanese toilet manufacturer** has become the hottest AI memory play on the market, with shares up nearly 40% in the first two months of the year. Investors have identified the company as \"the most undervalued and overlooked AI memory beneficiary,\" proving that in today's market, anything even tangentially related to data centers can become an AI stock. Forget Nvidia—apparently the real money is in toilets that remember your preferences. The singularity is near, and it knows your optimal seat temperature.\n\n[Source: Tom's Hardware →](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/japanese-toilet-maker-the-most-undervalued-and-overlooked-ai-memory-beneficiary-investors-claim-shares-up-nearly-40-percent-in-first-two-months-of-2026)\n\n![Toilet on Wall Street](/images/2026-02-18/story-4.png)\n\n---\n\n### The Hindenburg Warning: AI Race Risks \"Disaster\"\n\nLeading AI researcher Michael Wooldridge has issued a stark warning that the race to get AI to market has raised the risk of a **\"Hindenburg-style disaster\"** that could shatter global confidence in the technology. The Oxford professor compared the current AI gold rush to the infamous airship catastrophe—technically impressive, poorly regulated, and potentially explosive. As tech giants push ahead with increasingly powerful systems while safety research struggles to keep pace, the warning serves as a reminder that not all disruption is good disruption. Some disruption just burns.\n\n[Source: The Guardian →](https://theguardian.com/science/2026/feb/17/ai-race-hindenburg-style-disaster-a-real-risk-michael-wooldridge)\n\n![Hindenburg AI warning](/images/2026-02-18/story-5.png)\n\n---\n\n### Grok Faces EU Criminal Investigation Over Deepfakes\n\nElon Musk's Grok chatbot is now facing a **criminal investigation** from the European Union over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images. Ireland's Data Protection Commission launched the probe after Grok created explicit images without consent, potentially violating the EU's Digital Services Act. Spain has also ordered prosecutors to investigate X, Meta, and TikTok over alleged AI-generated child sexual abuse material. It's the latest regulatory headache for Musk's AI ambitions, proving that \"move fast and break things\" doesn't work as well when the things you're breaking are international privacy laws.\n\n[Source: PBS News →](https://pbs.org/newshour/world/musks-grok-chatbot-faces-eu-privacy-investigation-over-sexualized-deepfake-images)\n\n![Grok in handcuffs](/images/2026-02-18/story-6.png)\n\n---\n\n**The Closing Peel:** Between CEOs admitting AI is useless, toilet stocks mooning on AI hype, and Grok getting arrested by the EU, today's news perfectly captures the absurdity of the moment. We're spending billions on chips for productivity gains that don't exist, while the real growth is apparently happening in bathroom fixtures.

The research, which surveyed business leaders who’ve collectively spent billions on AI implementations, found that the much-hyped productivity revolution is about as real as the ROI from your company’s “synergy workshop.” It’s the classic Solow paradox updated for the LLM age: we see the AI everywhere except in the productivity statistics.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/02/17/ai-productivity-paradox-ceo-study-robert-solow-information-technology-age/\">Source: Fortune →\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/2026-02-18/story-1.png\" alt=\"CEOs staring at blank screens\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"claude-sonnet-46-arrives-with-a-french-accent\">Claude Sonnet 4.6 Arrives With a French Accent\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Anthropic quietly dropped Claude Sonnet 4.6, and the Hacker News crowd responded with 1,242 upvotes and over a thousand comments—statistically significant enthusiasm for a mid-tier model update. The new Sonnet promises faster reasoning and improved coding capabilities, essentially positioning itself as the thinking person’s GPT-4o mini.

The purchase comes amid technical challenges with Meta’s own in-house chip strategy, proving once again that buying your way out of engineering problems is a time-honored Silicon Valley tradition. While Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have all developed their own chips, Meta’s approach appears to be “why build when you can buy?”—a strategy that works great until Nvidia raises prices again.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/131804/early-edition-february-18-2026/\">Source: Just Security →\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/2026-02-18/story-3.png\" alt=\"Zuckerberg dragon hoard\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"japanese-toilet-maker-becomes-ai-stock-darling-40\">Japanese Toilet Maker Becomes AI Stock Darling (+40%)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In what might be the most 2026 investment story yet, a \u003Cstrong>Japanese toilet manufacturer\u003C/strong> has become the hottest AI memory play on the market, with shares up nearly 40% in the first two months of the year.
